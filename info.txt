This is a basic bank loan approval system. Here's a brief overview of each part:

We define three classes: Customer, LoanApplication, and Bank.
The Bank class has methods to apply for loans and process applications.
The core logic is in the _evaluate_application method, which uses a point-based system to decide whether to approve a loan.
The main block at the bottom demonstrates how to use the system with some example customers and loan applications.

To run this code, execute the file using Python. The output will show the results of the example loan applications.
